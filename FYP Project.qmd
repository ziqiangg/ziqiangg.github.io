# About This Site

This page presents the capstone project idea for my Final Year Project (FYP) in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Singapore Institute of Technology.

# Capstone Project Idea:
## **LiDAR and AI-Integrated Home Surveillance System for Elderly Safety**

### Project Summary

The proposed project aims to develop an intelligent home surveillance system that combines **LiDAR** (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors with **AI-based activity recognition models** to monitor and enhance the safety of elderly individuals living alone.

### Objectives

- Utilize LiDAR for precise indoor environment mapping and motion tracking.
- Develop AI models to detect critical events such as:
  - Falls
  - Unusual inactivity
  - Hazardous movements (e.g., wandering into unsafe areas)
- Integrate real-time alert notifications to caregivers or family members via a secure dashboard or mobile app.

### Key Technologies

- **LiDAR sensors** for non-intrusive, privacy-preserving spatial awareness.
- **Computer vision and deep learning models** (e.g., LSTM, CNN) for human activity recognition.
- **Edge AI deployment** for low-latency, real-time monitoring.
- Optional: Fusion with **IoT devices** (e.g., wearables, smart home sensors).

### Motivation

With the global aging population rising, there is a growing demand for intelligent, privacy-respecting, and non-invasive surveillance systems to ensure the well-being of elderly individualsâ€”especially those who live independently.

### ðŸ”§ Tools and Platforms

- **Python / R** for data processing and AI modeling
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** for deep learning
- **ROS / Arduino / Raspberry Pi** for sensor integration (if applicable)
- **Shiny / Quarto** for building an interactive monitoring dashboard
