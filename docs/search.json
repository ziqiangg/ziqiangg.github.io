    "text": "Ô∏è What is the GenAI tool you have used? Why did you choose it?\nThe GenAI tool I have used is ChatGPT. I chose this tool because it is known for its versatility, ease of use, and strong support for coding, writing, and explanation of technical concepts. It also integrates well with R and Python, which are relevant to my coursework in Applied Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\nHow did the GenAI tool help you in completing the assessment (with examples)?\nChatGPT helped me in several ways during my assessments:\n\nClarifying Concepts: When I was unsure about how to format a Quarto website or configure a YAML file, ChatGPT explained it clearly and gave me ready-to-use examples.\nCode Assistance: It provided code snippets for adding pages like about.qmd and funfacts.qmd, and helped troubleshoot issues such as broken navbars.\nContent Generation: For example, it helped me draft personal introductions for my funfacts.qmd and ideas for my FYP project involving LiDAR and AI.\nReflection Writing: Like this very document‚ÄîChatGPT helped structure and phrase my thoughts into coherent sections.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think are beneficial about the tool?\nSome benefits of using ChatGPT include:\n\nFast and personalized support, especially for technical tasks.\nHelps overcome writer‚Äôs block by suggesting content or phrasing.\nSaves time by generating clean and accurate code or explanations.\nImproves understanding through interactive clarification of complex topics.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think are challenging about the tool?\nDespite its benefits, there are a few challenges:\n\nOver-reliance: It‚Äôs easy to become dependent on the tool instead of solving problems independently.\nInaccuracy: Occasionally, it may give outdated or incorrect suggestions, so double-checking is necessary.\nLack of context: If prompts are unclear or vague, the responses might miss the mark.\n\n\n\nHow do you think GenAI tools will assist you for your future study or work?\nIn the future, I believe GenAI tools will:\n\nAssist with research by summarizing papers and generating code for experiments.\nSupport learning by explaining new concepts interactively.\nBoost productivity at work by helping write reports, debug code, or brainstorm ideas.\nEnable rapid prototyping of AI solutions, especially when integrating new technologies like LiDAR or IoT.\n\nOverall, GenAI tools like ChatGPT will become a valuable co-pilot in both academic and professional settings."
