# Personal Introduction

Outside of academics, I really enjoy staying active and one of my favorite hobbies is *playing volleyball*.

# Academic Interests

Among the modules I've taken so far, **Math 1** and **Math 2** have been my absolute favorites. I’ve enjoyed the logical thinking and problem-solving involved, and they’ve given me a strong foundation for understanding AI and data science concepts more deeply.

# Looking Ahead

I’m excited to continue exploring the intersections of math, AI, and real-world applications as I progress through the program.
