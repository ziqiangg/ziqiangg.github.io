# Personal Introduction

Outside of school, I enjoy:

- Playing **volleyball** üèê ‚Äî it helps me stay active and develop teamwork skills.
- **Motorcycles** - something that my father and I share a passion for. [Dream Bike](https://motor-fan.jp/bikes/article/92467/){target="blank"}
- Working on small coding projects

# Academic Interests

Among the modules I've taken so far, **Math 1** and **Math 2** have been my absolute favorites. I‚Äôve enjoyed the logical thinking and problem-solving involved, and they‚Äôve given me a strong foundation for understanding AI and data science concepts more deeply.

# Looking Ahead

I‚Äôm excited to continue exploring the intersections of math, AI, and real-world applications as I progress through the program.
